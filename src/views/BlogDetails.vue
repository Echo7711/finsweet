      Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, 
      and sometimes we are unsure about how to get the right word. 
      To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted 
      to build a Figma plugin for the larger design community. 
      The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX 
      copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation 
      ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to build this 
      Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, â€˜Designing voice
       and tone for error messages.
